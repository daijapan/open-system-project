(Why We Do)

with my huge respect to Y Combinator, Audrey Tang, other superstarts in the Computer Science history
I am a big fan of Neon Genesis Evagelion - they have a secret "Seele" system for decision making to "end the world".
We are the reverse version of "Seele". We are " a fully transparent system" to make "the sustainable world"
